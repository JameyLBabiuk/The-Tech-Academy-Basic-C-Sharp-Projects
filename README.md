# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository, "The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects". This repository will contain all the coding projects that I will be working on as part of the Basic C-Sharp course at The Tech Academy.

As I progress through the course, I will be updating this repository with the changes and improvements made to each project. This repository will serve as an online portfolio of my coding skills, and I will be using it to showcase my work to potential employers.

I am excited to be working on these projects and look forward to sharing my progress with you. Thank you for visiting my repository, and please feel free to provide feedback or suggestions to help me improve my coding skills.
